BASE64:

The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
strings of 4 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
of which is translated into a single character in the base 64
alphabet.

Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
output string.

A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
represented per printable character.  (The extra 65th character, "=",
is used to signify a special processing function.)

BASE32:

The encoding process represents 40-bit groups of input bits as output
strings of 8 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
40-bit input group is formed by concatenating 5 8bit input groups.
These 40 bits are then treated as 8 concatenated 5-bit groups, each
of which is translated into a single character in the base 32
alphabet.

Each 5-bit group is used as an index into an array of 32 printable
characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
output string.  These characters, identified in the table below, are
selected from US-ASCII digits and uppercase letters.

When a bit stream is encoded via the base 32 encoding, the
bit stream must be presumed to be ordered with the most-significant-
bit first.  That is, the first bit in the stream will be the high-
order bit in the first 8bit byte, the eighth bit will be the low-
order bit in the first 8bit byte, and so on.

A 33-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 5 bits to be
represented per printable character.  (The extra 33rd character, "=",
is used to signify a special processing function.)
